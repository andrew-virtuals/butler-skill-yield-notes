# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- First prototype. Screens and quotes fully collateralised single-leg notes
  (cash-secured put, covered call) against Derive's public API.
- Quote-time liquidity gating instead of an asset allowlist: a note is offered only
  when the bid is within 5 vol points of mark, fees are under 15% of the premium,
  and the best bid covers the whole note. On a measured day that clears ETH and BTC
  and rejects the other ten listed assets.
- Monthly tenors by default. Weeklies lose ~15% of the premium to fees at $5,000 and
  far more below that, so the fee-drag gate rejects them at retail size.
- Money paths (`open`, `close`, `positions`, `withdraw`) refuse with an explanation
  until spikes A1 and A4 pass.
